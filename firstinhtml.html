    <h1>Animal</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Animals</strong> are <em>multicellular, eukaryotic</em> in the
      <em>biological kingdom</em> <strong>Animalia.</strong> With few
      exceptions, <em>animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen,</em> are
      able to move, can <em>reproduce sexually</em>, and go through an
      ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of
      <em>cells</em>, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5
      million living animal species have been described—of which around 1
      million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million
      animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres
      (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with
      each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.<ins>The
        scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</ins> All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.[21] <del>The most famous one on the list, the dodo was a small flightless bird that got extinct 100 years after its discovery.</del>
